# The WP Community Collective Board of Director Memos

This folder contains formal memos that the board of directors has reviewed-and-received for The WP Community Collective.

Each memo is documented as an accessible (tagged) PDF and serves as a record of practices received and reviewed by the Board of Directors.

## Folder Purpose

This subfolder is part of the `practices` repository and is used to archive individual memos in a structured format. Each file should be named clearly, including the date and topic of the resolution, (e.g., `2025-03-resolution-governance-framework.pdf`)

## Guidelines

- All files must be approved by the board before being added.
- Use accessible PDF format for finalized documents.

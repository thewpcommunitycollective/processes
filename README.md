# The WP Community Collective Processes Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for the policies and practices that guide how The WP Community Collective operates. It houses links to The WPCC’s official governance policies and operational practices, ensuring clarity, transparency, and consistency in how we work.

The policies and practices outlined here are maintained by The WPCC Board of Directors in alignment with the organization’s mission, values, and legal responsibilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository provides direct access to two key collections:

- [`policies`](https://github.com/thewpcommunitycollective/policies) — Governance policies implemented by The WPCC Board of Directors to direct how the organization will be governed, including decision-making structures, roles and responsibilities, and oversight procedures. Policies are legally required operating procedures.

- [`practices`](https://github.com/thewpcommunitycollective/practices) — Operational practices that detail how The WPCC functions day-to-day, including documentation standards, tool usage, and internal workflows. These are best practices and operating procedure for the organization, but they are not a legal obligation.

Each of these sub-repositories contains living documentation that will evolve as the organization grows and adapts.

## Purpose

The Processes repository was created to:

- Centralize access to governance and operational documentation
- Promote transparency and consistency across all WPCC initiatives
- Enable community members, contributors, and staff to reference and implement shared processes with confidence
